## Running samples

Each sample can be run with 

```
./gradlew :<sample-name>:run
```

Then navigate to [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) to see the sample home page.  
 
Some samples require additional setup as explained in their readme files.
   
## Cut-and-pasting samples

Each sample is a standalone Gradle project that can be cut-and-pasted to get started with your own project. 
Cut-and-paste the directory of the corresponding sample together with 
its build scripts and add [gradle.properties](gradle.properties) from the root
that declares Kotlin, Ktor, and other versions. You may remove reference to the versions that
this particular sample does not use.

Samples with other build systems (Maven) are fully standalone and can be cut-and-pasted to get started.
